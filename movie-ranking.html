<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>The Shawshank Redemption is about a man who stays hopeful and strong in prison despite being innocent, and the best part is when he cleverly escapes after years of planning.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Inception is about a skilled thief who enters people’s dreams to steal secrets, and the best part is the thrilling, mind-bending scene where dreams within dreams blend together in an epic heist.</p>
<h3>Shutter island</h3>
<p>Shutter Island is about a U.S. Marshal investigating a missing patient at a mental hospital, and the best part is the shocking twist that changes everything he—and the audience—thought was true.</p>
